This is a complete random-state scrambler for the Curvy Copter, a complicated shapeshifting twisty puzzle.

Upon running the python code, simply input the number of scrambles you would like, or 0 to quit. The scrambles are provided in SALOW notation. Each move is described by the edge which is rotated. UL denotes a 180° rotation, while UL+ and UL- denote ~60° clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.

Code for generating both full scrambles and for generating parity-free cubeshape-only scrambles is provided.
